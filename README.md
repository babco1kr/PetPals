# Pet Pals

### Project-2



## Pet Pals is a application used for listing and searching for pets to pet-sit. It's for anyone wanting to list their pet to be pet-sat or for anyone looking make some extra money pet-sitting. 


#### Why the project is useful
According to Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly three-quarters of U.S. households own pets. There are about 218 million pets in the United States, not counting several million pet fish. This application solves the problem when the average pet-parent might not have the time or accessibility to walk, spend time or care for their pet for any number of reasons such as vacations, working long hours, emergencies and more.




#### What the project does:
This application allows the user to sign up and log into the application where you will be taken to the main page. From there, you can list your pet's to be watched. Choosing the "Search Pets" button will allow the user to search for other pets within the area to request to watch. 
As a pet owner, if you click the "Requests" button, it will display all the requests to watch your animal that you listed.


#### How users can get started with the project:
Users can get started by entering their Name, email and password to sign up. If the email and password is already in use, it will flag an error and instruct you to go back and log in with those credentials or sign up using a different email.
Once the user is in, they can select "User Account" and list their animal if they choose to list their pet. When doing so, the user will have to enter their pet's name, zip code where the pet is located, the pet type (ie: cat, dog, reptile, bird, other), the price, URL photo link of their pet and any additional info they feel is neccesary to include. 
Being a pet owner is not a requirement to sign up for this application. A non-pet-owner can sign up just the same, search for animals by zip-code by clicking on the "Search Pets" button and request to watch them, where their request will sit until it is approved or denied. Requests can be accessed by clicking the "Requests" button.
