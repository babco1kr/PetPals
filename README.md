#Pet Pals

### Project-2


Why the project is useful
According to Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly three-quarters of U.S. households own pets. There are about 218 million pets in the United States, not counting several million pet fish. This application solves the problem when the average pet-parent might not have the time or accessibility to walk, spend time or care for their pet for any number of reasons such as vacations, working long hours, emergencies and more.




Where users can get help with your project
Who maintains and contributes to the project


What the project does:
This application allows the user to sign up and log into the application where you will be taken to the main page. From there, you can list your pet's to be watched. Choosing the "Search Pets" button will allow the user to search for other pets within the area to request to watch. 
As a pet owner, if you click the "Requests" button, it will display all the requests to watch your animal that you listed.


How users can get started with the project:
Users can get started by entering their Name, email and password to sign up. If the email and password is already in use, it will flag an error and instruct you to go back and log in with those credentials or sign up using a different email.
Once the user is in, they can select "User Account" and list their animal if they choose to list their pet. When doing so, the user will have to enter their pet's name, zip code where the pet is located, the pet type (ie: cat, dog, reptile, bird, other), the price, URL photo link of their pet and any additional info they feel is neccesary to list.
